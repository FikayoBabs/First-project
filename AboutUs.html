    This online mentoring program is all about mentoring and masterminding to get help now.
What is mentoring? Simply put, mentoring is a relationship in which a mentee can acquire hindsight from a mentor before he or she begins a project to help him or her avoid costly mistakes. What would it be like if you could have hindsight on a project before you begin?
To find out more about our goals please scroll down.
If you are a mentee or a mentor, you can join and search for a mentor or mentee in any of our categories. We encourage suggestions for new categories. Simply go to ‘Contact Us.’
This online mentoring program is a free self-serve web matching service for adult mentors and mentee’s, promoting continuing education utilizing the natural human process of mentoring.
If you are a mentor, please join and share your knowledge and experience with someone who needs it. It’s a way to give back. We are looking for one million mentors. Pay it forward.
When you join, you can build a profile and search the database to find a mentor or mentee to communicate with, who has common interests or passions. You could build a mastermind group with other  members as well. We suggest 4 people as a great size for a mastermind group.
